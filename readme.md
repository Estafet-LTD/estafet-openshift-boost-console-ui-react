Front-end application for the Estafet Boost project build using React. More about requirements, technology stack and how to run in the sections bellow.

### Requirements

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* Package manager [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) or [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm), but preferably yarn üì¶

Use the package manager to install the dependencies.

```bash
yarn install
OR
npm install
```

### Commands


* **start** - Start the applications in production mode
* **start:dev** - Start the applications in development (watch) mode
* **build** - Bundle the application into the build folder
* **build:analyze** - Build the project and analyze the bundle using a [Webpack plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/webpack-bundle-analyzer)
* **test** - Runs the unit test suite using [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) in match mode
* **test:ci** - Runs the unit test suite in CI mode (verbose flag set and watch mode disabled)
* **postinstall** - Used as a hook to build the application when deploying in OpenShift; This script is skipped by default; enabled in Openshift with `POST_INSTALL=true`

### Running locally

Prior to starting the project, please configure the mandatory environment variables listed [here](env.md). Use the following command to start the project in development mode:

```bash
yarn start:dev
OR
npm run start:dev
```

The application will start at [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) by default. You can change to a desired port by using the **PORT** environment variable.

### Environment variables

### Technology

[React](https://reactjs.org/)

[Redux](https://react-redux.js.org/)

[Redux-saga](https://redux-saga.js.org/)

[styled-components](https://styled-components.com/)

..and much more ü§´

### GIT Workflow

Workflows are custom automated processes that you can set up in your repository to build, test, package, release, or deploy any project on GitHub. With workflows you can automate your software development life cycle with a wide range of tools and services.

[The current workflow](./.github/workflows/main.yml) is implemented to run on master or pull request pushes in order to verify that the project can still build and that the tests are passing with the applied changes.

[Read more about workflows](https://help.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/configuring-a-workflow)

### Testing

Testing is implemented by using [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) as a test runner, [Enzyme](https://enzymejs.github.io/enzyme/) for component testing and [redux-saga-test-plan](https://www.npmjs.com/package/redux-saga-test-plan) for saga testing. There is also a commit hook to run tests related to the applied changes.

*Note: Using [.silentRun()](https://github.com/jfairbank/redux-saga-test-plan/blob/master/docs/integration-testing/timeout.md#silencing-warnings) for the saga testing, because some of the sagas are using an infinite loop to achieve polling functionality*

### Linting and code formatting ü§®

Linting and code formatting is done by using [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) and [prettier](https://prettier.io/). [Git hooks](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Hooks) are configured using [husky](https://www.npmjs.com/package/husky)üêï and [lint-staged](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lint-staged) in order to prevent bad coding practices by linting and pre-formatting the code on every commit.

#### Commit message linting
Commit message are linted and certain rules are enforced by using [commitlint](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint/#what-is-commitlint). This is used in order to enforce better messages and descriptions for changes made to the codebase.

## To be implemented

[Future improvements and notes here](todo.md)

*To be extended in the future with more documentation on how the application is working*
